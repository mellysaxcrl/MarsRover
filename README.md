# MarsRover

initial coordinate position XY and direction are known
- implement solution to solve graph chart with 1 rover
- use kafka to talk to the microservice?

Bonus:
- implement solution to run with multiple rovers
- design the CLI interface
- rovers must not collide
- stop before collision, all commands afterwhich will be cancelled

- solution should be spring boot microservervice
- in memory data

Adv:
- write a reactJs for this 
- use logs (log4j or sl4j or logback) instead of println
